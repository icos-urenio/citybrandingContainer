# CITYBRANDING API controller class #

Make sure you have mcrypt module enabled (e.g. $ sudo php5enmod mcrypt)

Every request should contain token, m_id, l

* where *token* is the m-crypted "json_encode(array)" of username, password, timestamp, random in the following form:

**{'u':'username','p':'plain_password','t':'1439592509', 'r':'VxxXZR0dR9'}**

all casted to strings including the UNIX timestamp time()

* where *m_id* is the modality ID according to the REST/API key definition in the administrator side
* where *l* is the 2-letter language code used for for the responses translation (en, el, de, es, etc)

Every token is allowed to be used **only once** to avoid MITM attacks

Check [helpers/MCrypt.php](https://github.com/itsam/citybranding/blob/master/site/helpers/MCrypt.php) for details on how to use Rijndael-128 AES encryption algorithm

Please note that for better security it is highly recommended to protect your site with SSL (https)

## How to create a token
```php
$mcrypt = new MCrypt();
$mcrypt->setKey('1234567890123456'); //16 digits should match with administrator options
$data = array(
	'u'=>'itsam', 
	'p'=>'mysuperpassword',
	't'=>(string) time(),
	'r'=>$mcrypt->generateRandomString()
);
$json = json_encode($data);

$token = $mcrypt->encrypt($json);
echo $token; //<-- this token should be included in every API request

//quick verification
$decryptedData = $mcrypt->decrypt($token);
print_r(json_decode($decryptedData));
```
